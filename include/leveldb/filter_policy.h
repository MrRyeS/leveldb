// A database can be configured with a custom FilterPolicy object.
// This object is responsible for creating a small filter from a set
// of keys.  These filters are stored in leveldb and are consulted
// automatically by leveldb to decide whether or not to read some
// information from disk. In many cases, a filter can cut down the
// number of disk seeks form a handful to a single disk seek per
// DB::Get() call.
//
// Most people will want to use the builtin bloom filter support (see
// NewBloomFilterPolicy() below).

// ignores trailing spaces, it would be incorrect to use a
